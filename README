Bravura

Requirements:
  1. MongoDB
  2. Numpy
  3. Web2py

Bravura is time-series data visualization tool. It provides methods to store the data and perform various operations on it.
Operations currently supported are Standard Deviation, Mean, Rolling Mean, Aggregate, and Daily Change.

This is the first draft and I plan to improve it slowly.

Though I have mentioned that Bravura requires Web2py, you may use any other python server that you want. Files of importance in Bravura are

1. views/main.html
2. static/css/button.css
3. static/css/main.css
4. static/js/jquery.js
5. static/js/isotope.js
6. static/js/prototype.js
7. static/js/excanvas.js
8. static/js/lib/base64.js
9. static/js/canvas2image.js
10. static/js/canvastext.js
11. static/js/flotr.js
12. static/js/main.js
13. controllers/bravura.py

static/js/myscript.js shows how to instantiate Bravura
